      "Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon\nPoseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon, Poseidon\nIn all my years of living\nIt isn't very often that I get pissed off\nI try to chill with the waves\nBut damn, you crossed the line\nI've been so gracious\nAnd yet, you hurt this son of mine\nThat's right, the cyclops you made blind, is mine\nNo\nI'm left without a choice and without a doubt\nGuess the pack of wolves is swimming with the shark now\nI've gotta make you bleed, I need to see you drown\nBut before you go, I need to make you learn how\nRuthlessness is mercy upon ourselves\n(Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves)\nRuthlessness is mercy upon ourselves\nOurselves\nYou are the worst kind of good 'cause you're not even great\nA Greek who reeks of false righteousness, that's what I hate\n'Cause you fight to save lives, but won't kill and don't get the job done\nI mean, you totally could have avoided all this had you just killed my son\nBut no\nYou are far too nice, mercy has a price\nIt's the final crack, we're bound to break the ice now\nYou reveal your name, then you let him live\nUnlike you, I've got no mercy left to give 'cause\nRuthlessness is mercy upon ourselves\n(Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves)\nRuthlessness is mercy upon ourselves\nOurselves\nAnd now it is finally time to say goodbye, today you die\nUnless, of course, you apologize\nFor my son's pain and all his cries\nPoseidon, we meant no harm\nWe only hurt him to disarm him\nWe took no pleasure in his pain\nWe only wanted to escape\nThe line between naÃ¯vetÃ© and hopefulness is almost invisible\nSo close your heart, the world is dark and\nRuthlessness is mercy\nDie\nRuthlessness is mercy upon our- (Captain, Captain)\nRuthlessness is mercy upon our- (Captain, Captain)\nRuthlessness is mercy upon our- (Captain, Captain)\nRuthlessness is -\nWhat have you done?\nWhen does a ripple become a tidal wave?\n43 left under your command\nWhen does man become a monster?\nI am your darkest moment\nThe monster that always draws near\nAny last words?\nAll I gotta do is open this bag\nWhat?\nRemember me",

A woman\n(What?) She had us in just two words\n\"Come inside\" (damn)\nWelcome to the best part of your lives\nGo ahead and rest wherever you like\nI've got you, don't worry, Circe's got you now\n(Only I stayed outside, but the rest went in)\nTake a seat\nLet me bring you all something to eat\nI bet you're tired from the years spent on your feet\nI've got you, don't worry, Circe's got you now\n(By the time they ate, it was far too late)\nFor inside the meal (think of your past)\nShe had cast a spell (and your mistakes)\nThey began to squeal (they'll be the last)\nAnd grow snouts and tails (mistakes you'll make)\nShe changed them\nI've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power\nNo, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer\nNo, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah\nThey transformed (this is the price)\nAnd it wasn't quick (we pay to live)\nShe turned our men (the world does not)\nFrom men to pigs (tend to forgive)\nShe changed them\nI've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power\nNo, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer\nNo, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah\nno, we don't\nLook at all we've lost and all we've learned\nEvery single cost is so much more than what we've earned\nThink about the men we have left before there's none\nLet's just cut our losses, you and I, and let's run\nOf course, I'd like to leave now, of course I'd like to run\nBut I can hardly sleep now knowing everything we've done\nThere's no length I wouldn't go if it was you I had to save\nI can only hope you'd do the same\nI can hear her still (no one will find)\nAnd her voice deceives (their way between)\nWhat if she can't be killed? (My nymphs and I)\nWill you choose to leave? (Their loving queen)\n(I don't know)\nI've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power\nNo, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer\nNo, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah\nShe's a clever witch (this is the price)\nAnd she's hard to slay (we pay to love)\nIt's a game of wits (we draw the line)\nBut you don't have to play (watch from above)\nI have to try\nI've got all the power, yeah, I've got all the power\nNo, I'm not a player, I'm a puppeteer\nNo, I don't play, I puppeteer, yeah",

Oh-whoa\nScrew this competition, we've been here for hours\nNone of us can string this, we don't have the power\nScrew this damn challenge, no more delays\nCan't you guys see we're bein' played?\nThis is how they hold us down while the throne gets colder\nHold us down while we slowly age\nHold us down while the boy gets bolder\nWhere in the hell is our pride and our rage?\nHere and now, there's a chance for action\nHere and now, we can take control\nHere and now, burn it down to ashes\nChannel the fire inside your soul\nHaven't you noticed who's missin'?\nDon't you know the prince is not around?\nI heard he's on a diplomatic mission\nAnd I heard today he comes back to town, so\nI say, we gather near the beaches\nI say, we wait 'til he arrives\nThen, when he docks his ship, we can breach it\nLet us leave now, today we can strike and\nHold him down 'til the boy stops shakin'\nHold him down while I slit his throat\nHold him down while I slowly break his\nPride, his trust, his faith and his bones\nCut him down into tiny pieces\nThrow him down in the great below\nWhen the crown wonders where the prince is\nOnly the ocean and I will know\nAnd when the deed is done\nThe queen will have no one\nTo stop us from breakin' her bedroom door\nStop us from takin' her love and more\nAnd then we'll hold her down while her gate is open\nHold her down while I get a taste\nHold her down while we share her spoils\nI will not let any part go to waste\nHere and now, there's a chance for action (chance for action)\nHere and now, we can take control (take control)\nHere and now, burn it down to ashes\nChannel the fire inside your soul and\nHold 'em down, hold 'em down (hold 'em down, oh)\nHold 'em down, hold 'em down\nHold 'em down, hold 'em down (hold 'em down)\nChannel the fire inside your soul, and (hold 'em down, hold 'em down)",

    lyrics:
      "For twenty years, I've suffered every punishment and pain\nFrom the wrath of gods and monsters to the screams of comrades slain\nI come back and find my palace desecrated, sacked like Troy\nWorst of all, I hear you dare to touch my wife and hurt my boy\nI have had enough\nOdysseus, Odysseus\nOdysseus, Ody-\nIn the heat of battle, at the edge of the unknown\nSomewhere in the shadows lurks an agile, deadly foe\nWe have the advantage, we've the numbers and the might\nNo\nYou don't understand it, this man plans for every fight\nOdysseus, Odysseus\nOdysseus, Odysseus\nWhere is he? Where is he?\nKeep your head down, he's aimin' for the torches\nOur weapons, they're missing\nHe's using the darkness to hide his approaches\nWe're empty handed, up against an archer\nOur only chance is to strike him in the darkness\nWe know these halls, the odds can be tilted\nYou don't think I know my own palace? I built it\nOdysseus, Odysseus\nOdysseus, Odysseus\nOld king, our leader is dead\nYou've destroyed the serpent's head\nNow the rest of us are no longer a threat\nOld king, forgive us instead\nSo that no more blood is shed\nLet's have open arms instead\nNo\nOdysseus, Odysseus\nOdysseus, Odysseus\nDamn, he's more cunning than I assumed\nWhile we were busy plotting\nHe hid our weapons inside this room\nI find it hard to believe that the sharpest of kings\nLeft his armory unlocked\nSo what?\nNow that we have armed ourselves\nLet's make the bastard rot\nBehind you!\nThrow down those weapons\nAnd I ensure you'll be spared\nAfter seeing what the king will do to us\nWe wouldn't dare\nI don't wanna hurt you\nBut trust me, I've come prepared\nHa! Your very presence has doomed the king, young prince\nWe don't fight fair\nStop\nBrothers, we got company and he's made a grave mistake\nLeft the weapons room unlocked, and now they're ours to take\nBrothers, come and arm yourselves, there's a chance for us to win\nWe can still defeat the king if we all attack the prince\nWhere is he? Where is he?\nCapture him, he's our greatest chance\nGet off me, get off me\nFight 'til the prince can barely stand\nHold him down, hold him down\nMake the king obey our command\nHold him down, hold him down\n'Cause if he won't, I'll break the kid's hands\nGot him\nMe-mer\nMercy? Mercy?\nMy mercy has long since drowned\nIt died to bring me home\nAnd as long as you're around\nMy family's fate is left unknown\nYou plotted to kill my son\nYou planned to rape my wife\nAll of you are going to die\nOdysseus\nYou've filled my heart with hate\nAll of you, who have done me wrong\nThis will be your fate\nOdysseus\nOdysseus",

      "Father?\nSon\nAll my life, I'd've died to meet you\nThought about your name so much, it hurts\nFor 20 years, I've dreamt of how I'd greet you\nOh, and now you're here, I can't find the words\nAll my life, I'd have died to know you\nDays and nights I wish that I could show you\nFor 20 years, I never could outgrow you\nOh, and now you're here\nI can't help but wonder what your world must be\nIf we're like each other, if I have your strength in me\nAll this time I've wondered if you'd embrace me as your own\n20 years, I've wandered, for so long I've felt alone\nOh, my son, look how much you've grown\nOh, my boy, sweetest joy I've known\n20 years ago I held you in my arms\nHow time has flown, oh\nUsed to say I'd make the storm clouds cry for you\nUsed to say I'd capture wind and sky for you\nHeld you in my arms, prepared to die for you\nOh, how time has flown\nI can only wonder what your world has been\nThings you've had to suffer, and the strength you hold within\nAll I've ever wanted was to reunite with my own\n20 years, we've wandered, but today you're not alone\nMy son, I'm finally home\nHome, home\nFather, how I've longed to see you\nHome, home\nTelemachus, I'm home (home)\nGo, tell your mother I'm home\nI'll be there in a moment, of course\nShow yourself\nI know you're watching me, show yourself\nYou were never one for hellos\nI can't help but wonder what this world could be\nIf we all held each other with a bit more empathy\nI can't help but feel like I led you astray\nWhat if there's a world where we don't have to live this way?\nIf that world exists, it's far away from here\nIt's one I'll have to miss, for it's far beyond my years\nYou might live forever, so you can make it be\nBut I've got one endeavor, there's a girl I have to see\nVery well\nFather? She's waiting for you",

    lyrics:
      "Penelope\nIs it you? Have my prayers been answered?\nIs it really you standing there, or am I dreaming once more?\nYou look different, your eyes look tired\nYour frame is lighter, your smile torn\nIs it really you, my love?\nI am not the man you fell in love with\nI am not the man you once adored\nI am not your kind and gentle husband\nAnd I am not the love you knew before\nWould you fall in love with me again\nIf you knew all I've done?\nThe things I cannot change\nWould you love me all the same?\nI know that you've been waiting, waiting for love\nWhat kinds of things did you do?\nLeft a trail of red on every island\nAs I traded friends like objects I could use\nHurt more lives than I can count on my hands\nBut all of that was to bring me back to you\nSo tell me\nWould you fall in love with me again\nIf you knew all I've done?\nThe things I can't undo\nI am not the man you knew\nI know that you've been waiting, waiting\nIf that's true, could you do me a favor?\nJust a moment of labor that would bring me some peace\nSee that wedding bed? Could you carry it over?\nLift it high on your shoulders and take it far away from here\nHow could you say this?\nI had built that wedding bed with my blood and sweat\nCarved it into the olive tree where we first met\nA symbol of our love everlasting\nDo you realize what you have asked me?\nThe only way to move it is to cut it from its roots\nOnly my husband knew that\nSo I guess that makes him you\nPenelope\nI will fall in love with you over and over again\nI don't care how, where, or when\nNo matter how long it's been, you're mine\nDon't tell me you're not the same person\nYou're always my husband and I've been waiting, waiting\nPenelope\nWaiting, waiting (Penelope)\nWaiting, waiting\nWaiting, oh\nFor you\nHow long has it been?\nTwenty years\nI, I love you",
